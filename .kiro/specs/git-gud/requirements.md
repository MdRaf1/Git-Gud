# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Git Gud is an AI-powered command-line assistant designed to make Git usage safer and more intuitive. The tool translates natural language into Git commands and provides proactive advice to prevent common mistakes. This Phase 1 focuses on building a solid, safe foundation with core CLI functionality, Git interaction capabilities, and comprehensive safety mechanisms before implementing AI features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute Git commands through a CLI interface, so that I can interact with Git in a controlled environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `git-gud --execute "<git_command>"` THEN the system SHALL parse and process the Git command
2. WHEN the user provides a command string THEN the system SHALL capture the entire input as a single string
3. WHEN the CLI is invoked THEN the system SHALL provide clear usage instructions if no arguments are provided
4. WHEN invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to execute Git commands and return comprehensive output, so that I can see the results and any errors that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Git command is executed THEN the system SHALL capture stdout, stderr, and exit code
2. WHEN a command succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the stdout to the user
3. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL display both stdout and stderr with the exit code
4. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL return this information in a structured format to the calling function
5. WHEN the Git executable is not found THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to identify dangerous Git operations, so that I can avoid accidentally executing destructive commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command contains dangerous operations THEN the system SHALL identify it before execution
2. WHEN dangerous strings like "push --force", "reset --hard", or "filter-branch" are detected THEN the system SHALL flag the command as dangerous
3. WHEN a command is flagged as dangerous THEN the system SHALL NOT execute it immediately
4. WHEN a dangerous command is detected THEN the system SHALL display a clear warning explaining the specific risk
5. WHEN a dangerous command is detected THEN the system SHALL require explicit user confirmation before proceeding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to confirm dangerous operations before they execute, so that I can prevent accidental data loss or repository corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dangerous command is detected THEN the system SHALL prompt the user with "yes" confirmation
2. WHEN the user confirms with "yes" THEN the system SHALL proceed to execute the dangerous command
3. WHEN the user provides any response other than "yes" THEN the system SHALL abort the command execution
4. WHEN the user aborts a dangerous command THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation that the command was not executed
5. WHEN prompting for confirmation THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what the dangerous operation will do

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want safe Git commands to execute immediately without confirmation, so that my workflow remains efficient for routine operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command contains no dangerous operations THEN the system SHALL execute it immediately
2. WHEN safe commands like "git status", "git log", or "git diff" are used THEN the system SHALL not require confirmation
3. WHEN a safe command is executed THEN the system SHALL display the output directly to the user
4. WHEN determining command safety THEN the system SHALL check against a comprehensive list of dangerous patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI tool to be properly structured and maintainable, so that it can be extended with AI features in future phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL have separate modules for CLI, Git interaction, and safety checking
2. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN the Git interaction module is implemented THEN it SHALL use the subprocess module to interact with the system's Git installation
4. WHEN the safety module is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain a configurable list of dangerous Git operations
5. WHEN the CLI framework is chosen THEN it SHALL use either Typer or Click for command parsing
6. WHEN the application is packaged THEN it SHALL be installable as a Python package with proper entry points
